Quickly add a new post
===============

There must be a million scripts written by Jekyll bloggers to create a new post in the format Jekyll requires.

Here's mine; which obviously will be updated to:

1.  accept arguments for parameter variables that are currently hard coded,

1.  use an environment variable to record usual `BLOGPATH`,

1.  accept a different `BLOGPATH` as an optional override argument,


As is, it represents a bit of digging into `zsh`'s' Parameter Expansion functionality; which I later ditched in favour of `regexp-replace`. Why?

Please see an upcoming post describing why or how I switched back to using `zsh`'s parameter expansion expressions.


```sh
#!/bin/zsh

autoload -U regexp-replace

TITLE="Today's Title is tremend*& £s!"
FILENAME=$TITLE
regexp-replace FILENAME "[^[:alnum:]]" "_"
regexp-replace FILENAME "_{2,}" "_"
regexp-replace FILENAME "_+$" ""
regexp-replace FILENAME "^_+" ""

BLOGPATH='/Users/iain/WebDev/iainhouston.github.io/_posts/'

cat > ${BLOGPATH}`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`-${FILENAME}.markdown << EOF
---
title: ${TITLE}
date: `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" `
layout: post
---

$TITLE
===============

Text about ${TITLE} starts here
EOF
```
