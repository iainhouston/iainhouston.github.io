[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) is a terrific app. It's a lot more than an IOS Git Client.

I am using Working Copy for a number of tasks, and one I am keen to develop more, is doing bits of development of Swift IOS and Mac programs on my iPad Pro as [John Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/review-swift-playgrounds-30-for-ipad/) seems to do. 

BTW I am writing this post to my iainhouston.github.io account using the built-in editor of Working Copy. Commit; Push; and its published.

I had a few problems when trying to manage commivversion-control my Swift Playgrounds.

***Testimonial***  

In the time it took me to write a reasonably detailed description of my issue to the author, and post a summary of it here together with my workaround solution (since deleted), he, Anders Borum, got back to me with a simpler solution, and a promise to amend the (already excellent in all other respects), [documentation](https://workingcopyapp.com/manual/extending-ios) for which I am grateful, and very impressed.

***Simplest solution***

As provided by Anders Borum:  

>My favorite workflow is to start keep my playgrounds inside Working Copy 
>and to never copy them back and forth except perhaps the first time when 
>a project starts. 

>In the upper left corner of Swift Shortcuts you will see a "Location" button 
>which can open playgrounds in any part of the Files app including Working Copy 
>and work on them in-place. 
>If you open playground from here changes are written back to the repository ready 
>for commit and changes you pull down from the remote are available as well.
