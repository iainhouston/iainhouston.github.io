[Updated April 2024 for MacOS Sonoma]

Below is what I found worked quickly to allow me to draw on my iPad with the Apple Pencil whilst using Affinity (Publisher, Photo, Designer) 2.

To preserve the iPad's real estate, I leave the Affinity tools and Studios etc on the Mac and use the iPad for drawing.

## Separate Affinity's drawing canvas from studio controls etc.

1. Conect the iPad to the Mac with a USB cable

1. Open Affinity 2 on the Mac

1.  Choose "Window >> Float View to Window" which will create a separate "floating" window containing the "canvas".

1.  In MacOS, hover over the green dot at the top left of the Affinity (floated canvas) window and choose "Move to Iain's iPad"

Now I can select brushes and colours etc. on the Mac and zoom and draw with the Apple Pencil on the iPad
