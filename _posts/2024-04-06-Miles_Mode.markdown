Firstly, *Miles Mode* has a very arresting 8 bar motif. That's what I'm focusing on here; not only does it sound great, it has some very satisfying mathematical properties.

### What is Miles Mode?

It is a simple short tune written by John Coltrane and performed by him and the great quartet of 1962 consisting of  
  
-  John Coltrane – tenor saxophone  

-  Jimmy Garrison – double bass  

-  Elvin Jones – drums  

-  McCoy Tyner – piano

### What's the mathematical pattern?

1. The row of notes comprising the motif use all twelve note names once each. 

1. The motif is palendromic. The motif comprises an inital "cell" followed by that cell reversed i.e. a retrograde transformation of it. 

Anyway, most importantly, its sounds great, and the pattern of the note structure just caught my eye. 

I'm not sure it makes any difference to the way it is played. But I am sure that the ear of the listener picks up these "mathematical" patterns most likely subconsciously, so playing them accurately is important.
