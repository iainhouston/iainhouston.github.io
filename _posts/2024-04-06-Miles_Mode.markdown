Firstly, *Miles Mode* has a very arresting 8 bar motif. That's what I'm focusing on here; not only does it sound great, it has two very satisfying mathematical properties.

.  Its palendromic symmetry  
.  Its use of each of the twelve notes

### What is Miles Mode?

It is a simple short tune written by John Coltrane and performed by him and the great quartet of 1962 consisting of  
  
-  John Coltrane – tenor saxophone  

-  Jimmy Garrison – double bass  

-  Elvin Jones – drums  

-  McCoy Tyner – piano

### What's the structure?

The 32 bar head is:

.  8 bar motif (Rehearsal Mark "A" see below)  
.  16 bars improvised on B minor ("B")  
.  repeat "A"  


### What's the mathematical pattern?

1. The row of notes comprising the first 4 bars of the motif use all twelve note names once each. 

1. The motif is palendromic. The motif comprises an 2 bar inital "cell" followed by that cell reversed i.e. a retrograde transformation of it. 

Anyway, most importantly, its sounds great, and the pattern of the note structure just caught my eye. 

From what I gather, it is not a "twelve tone row" as prescribed by the most restrictive interpretations of Arnold Schoenberg's twelve tone concept in which a sequence of notes isn't supposed to describe conventional "tonal" structure. Whereas in the case of Miles Mode we have, consonant arpeggios in bars 1 and 2: Bmi F#mi Cmi7 ... in short, whatever they are, they form a more consonant melodic line than a twelve tone row usually is to my ears.

I'm not sure that the mathematical appreciation makes any difference to the way it is played. But I am sure that the ear of the listener picks up these "mathematical" patterns of symmetry and reversal most likely subconsciously, so playing them accurately is important.
