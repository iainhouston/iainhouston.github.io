You are welcome to [view the orchestral score in your browser as a PDF file][1]  

You are welcome to [listen to an audio file][2] too. It's a computer simulation of a performance generated by interpreting the orchestral score.  
I haven't spent any time enhancing the performance. What you hear is what the computer makes of the musical notation. This serves the purpose of this project: to have on my computer the means to explore this wonderful piece of music and how the composer uses the orchestra to produce these amazing sounds.
