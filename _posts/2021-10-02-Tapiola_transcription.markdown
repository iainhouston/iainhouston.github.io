You are welcome to [view the orchestral score in your browser as a PDF file][1]  

You are welcome to [listen to an audio file][2] too. It's a computer simulation of a performance generated by interpreting the orchestral score.  
I haven't spent any time enhancing the performance by tweaking playback settings or whatever. What you hear is raw, just what the computer makes of the musical notation. This serves the purpose of this project: to have on my computer the means to explore this wonderful piece of music and how the composer uses the orchestra to produce these amazing sounds.

If you'd like to know more about the software into which I  transcribed the orchestral score, then take a ook at [my previous post]({% post_url 2021-09-25-Dorico_iPad %})
