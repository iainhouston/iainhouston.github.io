So, I'm following @twostraws cours [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

I'm up to day 68 now and thoroughly enjoying it. Paul Hudson is a very talented teacher, and his remarkable course is absolutely free. Except you can't help yourself buying his stuff along the way - more power to his elbow!)

I'm also the proud owner of a new iPad Pro, and am keen to see how much I can get done on it: programming and web development (more on this in previous and future posts). 
I am writing this post on the Working Copy app, after having followed John Sundell for some time, was encouraged by his experiences with Swift [Playgrounds](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/review-swift-playgrounds-30-for-ipad/)

More to follow!
