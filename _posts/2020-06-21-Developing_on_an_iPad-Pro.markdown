So, I'm following @twostraws course [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

I'm up to day 68 now and thoroughly enjoying it. Paul Hudson is a very talented teacher, and his remarkable course is absolutely free. (Except you won't be able to help yourself buying snippets of his intelligence along the way - more power to his elbow!)

I'm also the proud owner of a new iPad Pro, and am keen to see how much I can get done on it: programming and web development (more on this in previous and future posts) as well as browsing; reading; drawing; graphic design with [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/); and storing all my music charts for rehearsals, practice, and performances using [forScore](http://forscore.co). 
I am writing this post on the [Working Copy app](https://workingcopyapp.com ), after having followed John Sundell for some time, was encouraged by his [experiences with Swift Playgrounds](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/review-swift-playgrounds-30-for-ipad/)

More to follow!
