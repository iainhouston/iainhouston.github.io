Neither Apple's nor Affinity's documentation was precisely informative when wanted to use MacOS Ventura's Sidecar with my iPad and Affinity Designer 2.

Below is what I found worked quickly to allow me to draw on my iPad with the Apple Pencil whilst using Affinity Designer 2.

I leave the tools and studios etc on the Mac and use the iPad for drawing.

## Separate Designer's drawing canvas from studio controls etc.

1.  In Designer, `click on Window >> Float View to Window`

1.  In the MacOS menu bar click on the Displays icon and then click `Mirror r Extend to >> Iain's iPad`

1.  Then choose `Use as sparate display`

1.  Now slide Designer's separate drawing window over right out of the Mac display and thus onto the iPad

Now I can select brushes and colours etc on the Mac and zoom and draw with the Apple Pencil on the iPad
